    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore how to use scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` class to exhaustively search through every combination of hyperparameters until we find optimal values for a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design a parameter grid for use with scikit-learn's GridSearchCV \n",
    "- Use GridSearchCV to increase model performance through parameter tuning \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we'll be working with the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning dataset repository. We'll be using data about the various features of wine to predict the quality of the wine on a scale from 1-10 stars, making this a multiclass classification problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can begin grid searching our way to optimal hyperparameters, we'll need to go through the basic steps of modeling. This means that we'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import and inspect the dataset (and clean, if necessary)\n",
    "* Split the data into training and test sets\n",
    "* Build and fit a baseline model that we can compare against our grid search results \n",
